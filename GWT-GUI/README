In one terminal window:

$ mvn gwt:codeserver -pl *-client -am

In another terminal window:

$ mvn jetty:run -pl *-server -am -Denv=dev

Open:
http://localhost:8082

Or if you'd rather use Tomcat than Jetty, use mvn tomcat7:run instead of mvn jetty:run.

Note that the -pl and -am are not strictly necessary, they just tell Maven not to build the client module when you're dealing with the server one, and vice versa.


To deploy on other application server just create war:

$ mvn package
